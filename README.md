# Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this webpage was to store all the learning and important points I have learned throughout the prework of the coding Bootcamp, so I can access them as efficiently and fast as possible. It also works as a study method to memorize the basics of the programming language and Git hub. It's a facilitator for new Bootcamp students to revisit their notes in an organized and dynamic manner.  In this project, I learned how different programming languages work collaboratively to create what we see as users in a webpage.
